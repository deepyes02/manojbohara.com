I've been coding for a few years and shied away from wordpress for a while. Even though wordpress isn't the main choice for sophisticated design, it can still be useful for :

- personal blogs
- small to medium sized business
- blogs for huge businesses too

I came back to wordpress to help my friend who is a photographer, videographer as well as a blogger.

I took this project because this is a real world project and a programmer shouldn't shy away from a project because of the programming language. Plus, wordpress makes it a lot easier with it's own MVC framework, and a programmer can get away from the complications of routes and whatnots.

The CMS wordpress provides is one of the main reasons it is useful since creating one from scratch is a bit time consuming.

Plus, in Nepal, wordpress has a huge market.

I will put out a video tutorial on building this website once I'm done with this project.

I have not included the configuration files for the sake of safety, which can be easily be downloaded. Once I get started with the plugins, I will also upload them in this folder.

You can't hate wordpress. Do comment or reach out if you have any suggestions. :-)
